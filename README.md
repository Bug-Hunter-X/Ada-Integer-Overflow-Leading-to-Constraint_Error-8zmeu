This example demonstrates a common error in Ada programming where exceeding the maximum value of the Integer type leads to a Constraint_Error exception. The code presents a function that adds one to an integer and then a procedure that calls this function, attempting to add the maximum Integer value to the result. This operation can lead to an unexpected Constraint_Error at runtime.  The solution will address this by using a suitable data type that can handle larger values, or by adding explicit checks to prevent overflows.
